## Getting Started

If you are new to this repository, here are the steps to get started with JavaScript learning:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Harut20024/JavaScript.git`.
2. Set up your development environment with a code editor like Visual Studio Code and install Node.js for running JavaScript outside the browser.
3. Explore the contents of the repository to access various JavaScript learning resources and personal projects.

## JavaScript Learning

In this section, you will find a series of JavaScript learning materials. These resources cover various topics, starting from the basics to more advanced concepts.

### JavaScript Basics

Learn the foundational elements of JavaScript, including variables, data types, operators, conditional statements, and loops.

### Control Flow

Understand how to control the flow of your code using if-else statements, switch statements, while loops, and for loops.

### Functions

Explore how to create and use functions, including function declaration, function expression, arrow functions, and handling function parameters and return values.

### Arrays

Learn how to work with arrays effectively, including creating arrays, accessing array elements, using array methods, and iterating through arrays.

### Objects

Discover how to work with objects in JavaScript, including creating objects, accessing object properties, and using object methods.

### DOM Manipulation

Understand how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) in the browser, including DOM selection, changing DOM elements, and event handling.

### Asynchronous JavaScript

Learn about asynchronous tasks in JavaScript, including callbacks, promises, and async/await.

## Personal Projects

In this section, you can find a collection of personal projects you have worked on and shared on this repository.

### Project 1: Test codes

In the Test codes folder, you can find my first codes which are not too hard, but they have logic functions. Here are some exercises that I have done.

### Project 2: Windows XP icon

I created this code where the Windows XP icon moves in a mini screen.

### Project 3: Canvas projects

This folder contains various projects where I work with the canvas and do some animations.

### Project 4: Name finder

In this project, you can write a name or a letter of a name, and it will give you back similar names. If you write the first letter of a name in lowercase, it will understand and give back the name in uppercase. The name table is refreshed only when you write, as it would be a resource-intensive project.

### Project 5: Ninja Game

In this project, I created a game where you play as a ninja and push fire into the knight. I used DOM and OOP standards, and I continually update this game.
